React Application Overview
1. Folder Structure:
The project is organized into components, with a specific file structure.
Components are separated into a folder, such as components, and have associated styles in a css file.
2. App.js:
Serves as the main entry point for the React application.
Manages the overall state of the application, including searchText and playerData.
Utilizes the Axios library for making HTTP requests to the League of Legends API.
Renders the Cabecera component, passing down necessary state and functions as props.
3. Cabecera.jsx:
Represents the header component of the application.
Receives searchText, setSearchText, and onSearch as props.
Displays a title, an input field for entering the player's name, and a button to initiate the search.
Updates the input value using the searchText prop and triggers the search function (onSearch) when the button is clicked.
4. Functionality:
User enters a player's name in the Cabecera component.
The entered text is managed by the searchText state in the App component.
When the search button is clicked, the onSearch function in the App component is triggered.
The onSearch function constructs an API call and uses Axios to fetch data from the League of Legends API.
The received data is stored in the playerData state in the App component.
The application conditionally renders player information or a message indicating that no data is available.
5. Styling:
Bootstrap is used for styling, as indicated by the import of the Bootstrap CSS file.
6. Footer:
A static footer displaying a message related to the League of Legends API is rendered at the bottom of the page.
7. State Management:
State related to the player's name (searchText) and player data (playerData) is managed in the App component.
These states are passed down as props to the Cabecera component for user interaction.
8. Error Handling:
Basic error handling using catch in the Axios request to log errors to the console.
9. Development Workflow:
The application leverages React hooks (useState) for managing state in functional components.
The components are structured to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
